"""
Package for solving eigenmodes on a 2D wave, diffusion steady states, and 
the Leapfrog method on an oscillator in 1D. 

This package provides functionality for solving eigenmodes of membranes,
including various shapes such as squares, rectangles, and circles. It also 
includes methods for solving steady-state diffusion equations using both 
direct and iterative methods.

A command-line interface is included for easy access to these simulations.
